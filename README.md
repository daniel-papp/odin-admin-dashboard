# Amin Dashboard

### Intermediate HTML and CSS project

In this project I created an admin dashboard using CSS Grid for most of the layout. Besides grid the project also uses previously learned concepts such as semantic html, active states for buttons and links, responsive design. 
I also implemented a dashboard collapse function with the help of JavaScript. Clicking the dashboard icon or title in the top right corner will collapse and expand the sidebar leaving more space for the sites main content.
